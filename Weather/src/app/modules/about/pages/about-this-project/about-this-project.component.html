<h2>Initial Requeriments:</h2>

<p>
Create a weather app complete with a login system.
<br>
The app needs a search prompt that reaches out to a weather api of your choice and has the ability to favorite the cities by zip code or name.
<br>
Once the city has been added, create a checker that keeps monitoring the city for temperature or condition changes.
<br>
There needs to be an alert and notification based on criteria. For example: notify if Miami is hotter than 82 degrees.
<br>
The alerts must be set to multiple cities. These checks should not be hardcoded.
</p>
